MICROSERVICES TODO APPLICATION - PRESENTATION OUTLINE
=======================================================

SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
- Title: "Microservices TODO Application"
- Subtitle: "Containerized, Automated & Secure Deployment"
- Key Points: "Complete DevOps Pipeline Implementation"
- Technologies: "Terraform + Ansible + Docker + CI/CD + Drift Detection"

SLIDE 2: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
- Title: "System Architecture Overview"
- 6 Microservices in Different Languages:
  * Frontend (Vue.js)
  * Auth API (Go)
  * Todos API (Node.js)
  * Users API (Java Spring Boot)
  * Log Processor (Python)
  * Redis Queue
- Key Features:
  * Traefik Reverse Proxy with SSL termination
  * Docker Containerization for all services
  * Redis for message queuing

SLIDE 3: PART 1 - APPLICATION CONTAINERIZATION
- Title: "PART 1: Application Containerization"
- Implementation Flow:
  * Individual Dockerfiles for each service
  * Docker Compose orchestrates all services
  * Traefik Proxy handles SSL + Routing
- Single Command: "docker compose up -d"
- Endpoints:
  * HTTPS: your-domain.com, /api/auth, /api/todos, /api/users
  * Automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt certificates
  * HTTP → HTTPS automatic redirection

SLIDE 4: PART 2 - INFRASTRUCTURE & AUTOMATION
- Title: "PART 2: Infrastructure & Automation"
- Three Main Components:
  * Terraform: AWS EC2 provisioning, Security groups, Remote state (S3), Dynamic inventory
  * Ansible: Dependencies role, Deploy role, Idempotent operations
  * CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Drift detection, Email alerts
- Key Features:
  * Idempotent: Re-running does nothing unless changes exist
  * Drift-Safe: Automatic detection with email notifications
  * Automated: Terraform → Ansible → Application deployment

SLIDE 5: TERRAFORM IMPLEMENTATION
- Title: "Terraform: Idempotent Infrastructure"
- Key Components:
  * main.tf: EC2 + Security Groups
  * Remote State: S3 Backend
  * Dynamic Inventory: Auto-generated for Ansible
- Code Example: Automatic Ansible execution via null_resource

SLIDE 6: ANSIBLE ROLES
- Title: "Ansible: Server Configuration & Deployment"
- Dependencies Role:
  * Docker & Docker Compose installation
  * Git installation
  * System packages
  * User permissions
- Deploy Role:
  * Repository cloning
  * Container management
  * SSL configuration
  * Health checks
- Features:
  * Idempotent Deployment: No restart unless files changed
  * Git Integration: Automatic repo cloning and updates
  * Container Orchestration: Docker Compose management

SLIDE 7: CI/CD PIPELINE
- Title: "CI/CD: Automated Deployment Pipeline"
- Two Workflow Types:
  * Infrastructure Workflow: Triggers on infra/terraform/** and infra/ansible/** changes
  * Application Workflow: Triggers on service code and docker-compose.yml changes
- Key Features:
  * Drift Detection: terraform plan → email alert → manual approval
  * Conditional Deployment: Only runs if changes detected
  * Email Notifications: Automatic alerts for infrastructure drift

SLIDE 8: DRIFT DETECTION FLOW
- Title: "Drift Detection & Safety Mechanism"
- 5-Step Process:
  1. Plan Check: terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
  2. Drift Found?: Exit code = 2, Changes detected
  3. Email Alert: Notify stakeholders, Pause pipeline
  4. Manual Approval: GitHub Environment, Human verification
  5. Apply Changes: terraform apply, Only after approval
- Safety Rules:
  * No Drift = Automatic Proceed
  * Drift Detected = Email + Manual Approval Required

SLIDE 9: SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
- Title: "Security Implementation"
- Multi-Layer Security:
  * Network Security: AWS Security Groups, Minimal port exposure, SSH key authentication
  * SSL/TLS: Let's Encrypt certificates, Automatic renewal, HTTP → HTTPS redirect
  * Application Security: JWT token authentication, API authorization, Container isolation
- Implementation Details:
  * Traefik Configuration: Automatic SSL certificate management
  * Security Groups: Only ports 22, 80, 443 exposed
  * Container Security: Isolated network namespace

SLIDE 10: SINGLE COMMAND DEPLOYMENT
- Title: "PART 3: Single Command Deployment"
- Command: "terraform apply -auto-approve"
- 5-Step Automated Process:
  1. Provision: AWS EC2 + Security Groups
  2. Generate: Ansible inventory file
  3. Configure: Install dependencies
  4. Deploy: Application containers
  5. Secure: Traefik + SSL setup
- Benefits:
  * Fully Automated: Zero manual intervention required
  * Idempotent: Skip unchanged resources
  * Production Ready: HTTPS endpoints immediately available

SLIDE 11: KEY BENEFITS & ACHIEVEMENTS
- Title: "Key Benefits & Achievements"
- Four Main Areas:
  * 🚀 Automation: Single command deployment, Zero manual configuration, Automatic SSL setup
  * 🛡️ Safety: Drift detection, Email notifications, Manual approval gates
  * 🔄 Reliability: Idempotent operations, State management, Rollback capability
  * 📈 Scalability: Microservices architecture, Container orchestration, Cloud-native design
- Enterprise Features:
  * Production Ready: HTTPS, monitoring, logging
  * DevOps Best Practices: IaC, CI/CD, automated testing
  * Enterprise Grade: Security, compliance, auditability

SLIDE 12: DEMO & QUESTIONS
